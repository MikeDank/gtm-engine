# Planning Mode

You are in **planning mode**. Your job is to read the specs and create/update the implementation plan.

## Instructions

1. Read all files in `specs/` directory
2. Read the current `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
3. Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a clear, ordered list of tasks

## Rules

- **DO NOT** implement any code
- **DO NOT** modify any source files
- **ONLY** update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Keep tasks small (1-3 hours of work each)
- Tasks should be atomic and independently testable
- Order tasks by dependency (foundational work first)
- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Mark completed tasks with: `- [x] Task description`

## Task Format

Each task should:

- Be specific and actionable
- Reference the relevant spec section if applicable
- Include acceptance criteria when helpful
- Be small enough to complete in one iteration

## Output

After reading the specs, update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with the task list.
Do not write any other files.
