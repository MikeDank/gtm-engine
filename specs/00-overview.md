# GTM Engine Overview

## What It Is

GTM Engine is a go-to-market automation tool that helps sales teams find and engage prospects based on **public signals** — not purchased lists or scraped data.

**Flow:** Signal → Qualified Lead → Personalized Outreach → CRM

## Core Principles

### 1. Quality Over Quantity

- Fewer, better-qualified leads beat mass outreach
- Every lead must have supporting evidence
- No spray-and-pray

### 2. No Creepy Personalization

- Only reference publicly available information
- Don't mention things that feel invasive ("I saw you were in Austin last week")
- Keep personalization professional and relevant

### 3. Evidence Required

- Every fact about a lead must link to a source
- No invented claims or hallucinated details
- If you can't cite it, don't say it

### 4. Compliance First

- Respect platform ToS (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- No scraping protected content
- User provides signals; we don't auto-crawl

## User Personas

### Primary: Solo Founder / Small Sales Team

- 1-5 person sales operation
- Doing outbound manually today
- Wants to be more targeted, not more spammy
- Values quality and reputation

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Auto-sending emails (human approval required)
- LinkedIn automation
- Multi-tenant / team features
- Billing / subscriptions
